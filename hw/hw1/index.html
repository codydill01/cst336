                Artificial Intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines. AI
                research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device
                that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its
                chance of successfully achieving its goals. It was founded as an academic
                discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced serveral
                waves of optimism.     
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence has progressed rapidly throughout the years.
                Having AI on mobile devices to having the abilitiy to have your car 
                drive itself, it seems as if the possibilities are endless. AI can
                encompass anything from Google's search algorithms to IBM's Watson
                to autonomous weapons. The idea of AI is to simple increase efficiency 
                throughout the day to allow businesses to be more effective and allow
                people more time. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The push that is presented to attach all activities with an AI assistance
                brings a question to mind; can AI be dangerous? Switching gears to 
                autonomous weapons they are dangerous because if they come into the hands
                of the wrong person it can cause mass casualities. Moreover, an AI arms race
                could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualities.
