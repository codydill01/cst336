                AI is relevant to any intellectual task and modern AI techniques 
                are pervasive. When a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no
                longer onsidered artificial intelligence. This was known as the 
                AI effect. A high profile example of AI use would be autonomous 
                vehicles, medical dianosis, creating art, proving mathematical
                theorems, playing games, search engines, online assistants, image
                recognition in photographs, spam filtering, prediction of judicial
                decisions and targeting online advertisements. As social media 
                has slowly taken over, major publishers started using AI to post
                stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic.

                Artificial intelligence broke into healthcare industry by assisting
                doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed
                AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer. There is 
                a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer.
                There are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This 
                negatively affects the doctors because there are too many options
                to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for 
                patients.

                Advancements in AI have contributed to the growth of the automotive
                industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles.
                As of 2016, there are over 30 companies utilizing AI into the
                creation of driverless cars. Many of the componets that contribute
                to self-driving cars are braking, lane changing, collision prevention,
                navigation and mapping. Recent developments in autonomous automobiles
                have made the innovation of self-driving trucks possible. One of the 
                main factors that influences the ability for a driver-less vehicle 
                is mapping.
