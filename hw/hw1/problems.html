                The research goal of AI is to create technology that allows computers
                and machines to work together in a intelligent manner. The problem of
                simulating intelligence has had many sub issues along the way during the 
                early phases. These consisted of particular traits that researchers
                expect an intelligent system to display.

               During the early phases of AI algorithems were developed that imitagted 
               step-by-step reasoning that humans used when solving puzzles. They also 
               created algorithems to understand the human logical deductions. In the late
               1980s and 1990s, AI research would develop methods for dealing with 
                uncertain or incomplete information and empoly concepts from probability
                and economics.

                Knowledge representation are central to classical AI research. A few of the 
                expert systems attempted to gather together explicit knowledge possessed
                by experts in some narrow doamin. Thus, commonsense knowledge was gathered
                and stored in a database to have a general understanding of the world. The 
                database contained objects, properties, causes and effects, and many other
                less researched domains.
