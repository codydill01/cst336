                There was no established theory that guildes AI research. The researchers
                disagreed about many issues and a few of the most long standing questions 
                still remain unanswered. Those questions would be should artifical intelligence
                simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurobiology? Can
                intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles? Or does it 
                necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems? 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                During the 1940s and 1950s a number of resesarcheres explored the 
                connection between neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics.
                Of those researchers some built machines that used electronic networks
                to exhibit rudimentary intelligence. When digital computers became
                relevant in the 1950s the AI researchers explored the possibility that
                human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The symbolic 
                approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level 
                thinking in small demonstration programs.

            <p>
                The good old fashioned AI or GOFAI got bogged down on ad hoc 
                patches to symbolic computation. This worked with the reseachers 
                own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. 
                Fast forwarding to 1990, AI researchers adopted sophisticated 
                mathematical tools such as hidden markov models, information theory
                and decision theory. Statistical learning techniques were gaining
                higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as data mining. 
                The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing 
                emhasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to 
                see which approach performed best in a broader context.
